# Spider Search System

Greetings!

This is my firs attempt to do something productive for ZeroNet.

For now it is Database with some trivial data on websites from ZeroNet. Planning to expand upon it to create a proper Spider-based search engine for ZeroNet.

## Install

Required dependencies are `python3`, with python packages `sqlite3`, `msgpack`, `gevent`.
